<p>
    Things to consider:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add different speeds by having more frames per second, and each creature only acts in a few frames - e.g. in every 100 frames,
        a creature with speed 20 acts in 100/20 = 5 of them.</li>
    <li>Work out pathfinding for large creatures using the "true clearance" metric described at
        http://harablog.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/clearance-based-pathfinding/ - start with 1 if it is passable, and
        expand a square down and to the right to increase the clearance score. A 2x2 creature needs a clearance score of 2, etc.</li>
    <li>AIGPW 3.5 (ARC) uses iterative deepening with a delay to cope with units blocked by transient properties like other
        units: reduces flooding when no route</li>
    <li>The speed of robots could change based on how much power they have - where power drops with time, and then
        builds up again when you reach a power socket.</li>
    <li>GPG3 3.6 - naive tactical pathfinding adds a "threatened" cost to the score, but this can be further improved by
        adding an additional cost the longer consecutive time a route is threatened (so exposure to the enemy 4 times for
        5 seconds each is better than exposure once for 20 seconds), and by assuming that an enemy occupies all of the
        squares that they are near (to simulate movement, and to encourage taking better advantage of cover).</li>
    <li>GPG4 7.1 - OpenAL is primarily an audio scene graph library, for 3D positional audio.</li>
    <li>GPG3 2.6 - use cellular automata for spreading phenomena like flooding and fire (excellent article, lots of detail)</li>
    <li>Use a blackboard to allow units to co-operate: post tasks to the blackboard, and units retrieve them</li>
    <li>Use religion as a motivation for robots to provide high-level goalseeking?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Storing the terrain as a simple list of items is hugely inefficient - it's the slowest part of pathfinding</li>
    <li>We could cache routes in the pathfinder (particularly good at that moment when robots mostly go between power
        sockets) - but hard to work out what we can best cache. Currently, source/destination tuples in a set would
        be effective, because most routes are the same - but this isn't likely to be true for long. </li>
    <li>Caching individual routes within the unit is sensible - the next 10 steps, or something like that. Possibly
        restrict it to only steps within the same zone, to avoid caching the long distance steps.</li>
    <li>GPG 3.3 - Use a binary heap, rather than the default priority queue, to store the open list in the
        pathfinder - requires fewer comparisons. </li>
</ul>


<h2>Implemented</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use hierarchical A* to improve performance - see
        http://harablog.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/hierarchical-clearance-based-pathfinding/. Split the area into larger scale
        nodes that have routes between them, and then you only need to find a path to the next node exit. It seems like for
        this to work, you'd need to have interconnection between your zones - i.e. if you can get to one part of the zone,
        you can get to all of it. But this means that zones could potentially change when you add obstructions within them.
        <ul>
            <li>I already have an algorithm for flood-fill - it's A* with no heuristic, and no terrain costs. This can be used
                for finding contiguous zones (and could be used for goal-seeking too...)</li>
            <li>To work out where zones end, some sort of weighted function based on how many open nodes versus how many
                closed nodes should find rooms (many closed, few open, means it's a zone - might also want a limit on number
                closed just to make sure we don't have everything as a single zone).</li>
            <li>A simpler initial algorithm could just count number of closed nodes. Need
                to make sure that inaccessible nodes don't make it onto the closed list.</li>
            <li>Zones will depend on the start points chosen - a possible optimization is to do the zoning multiple times,
                and choose the version that gives the "best" zones.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Improved Heuristics for Optimal Pathfinding on Game Maps (Bjornsson and Halldorsson) - provides an algorithm
        for dividing the map into zones.</li>
    <li>BGPG 3.2 - recommends using a hierarchical pathfinder, then using the lowlevel pathfinder to go to the second zone,
        not the first, to give a smoother route. (Also has the benefit that it removes a bug I was having)</li>
    <li>BGPG 3.3 - tweaking the heuristic to make it overestimate forces the pathfinder towards straight lines -
        which gives a speedup if obstacles can generally be avoided. Going from a simple taxi-cab distsnce, to 3 * that,
        improved performance by about 40%. Most correct is if it is close to the average cost.
    </li>

</ul>

<h2>Rejected</h2>
<ul>
    <li>AIGPW 3.2 (EE) uses an initial quick pathfind to start moving,
        and then a more expensive full pathfind to get the path correct: their example is from an open landscape, and this seems
        like it could go wrong in a confined space when all routes involve going in the opposite direction to start with. Instead
        a hierarchical system seems better.</li>
    <li>AIGPW 3.2 (EE) uses a Pathfinder manager,
        that uses time slicing to determine how much pathing time each unit gets. Not convinced by this - seems better to
        make it faster generally. </li>
    <li>Could we use some sort of ant-pheromone-trail to speed up pathfinding? If a route is commonly found to be the
        best route and travelled along, then that might make it lower cost because it's likely to be used by others too?
        Or would that lead to congestion? Or would that be unnecessary because if it's being used, it's the best route anyway?</li>
